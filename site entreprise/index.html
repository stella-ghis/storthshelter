			<h2>Our purpose ?</h2>
			<p> Welcome to our shelter !
				Storth Shelter is a place where we save animals and wish to offer them a better life.
				All of our animals have had a rather difficult history. Some have been abandoned, collected and cared for by our volunteer veterinarians. </p>

				

				<p> Have you found an abandoned or needy animal? Do not approach the animal and do not try to feed or move it. You can call us or contact the fire department. We will pick up the animal immediately. 
			</p>

      <p>Mars is a nearly 1 year old male.
		He comes from a litter of 6 kittens, but did not get along with his brothers and sisters. He had a tendency to attack them, in order to be the center of attention. Her family therefore decided that they could not keep him for the welfare of the other cats and kittens. Thus, he needs a family without any other animal, young childrens, and who has a lot of time to give to him.</p>

      <h1>Sparkle</h1>
      <p>Sparkle is a very emotional guinea pig of about 1 year old. We found him with his brothers in abandoned garbage on the side of a road. We managed to save them despite the lack of food. His two brothers have already been adopted, and only Sparkle is waiting for his new family. He is very calm, but needs a lot of love, because he sometimes cries when he is too lonely. We would like to find him, if possible, a home with another animal so that he feels more surrounded. </p>
